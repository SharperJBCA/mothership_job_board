This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## GM access setup

The admin routes check the authenticated user against the `gm_users` table.

**Required mapping:** `gm_users.user_id` must exactly match `auth.users.id` for the same user.

Example SQL:

```sql
insert into public.gm_users (user_id)
values ('<auth.users.id UUID>');
```

Optional local debug bypass:

- Set `ALLOW_DEBUG_GM_EMAILS` to a comma-separated list of email addresses to temporarily grant GM access during local debugging.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_ADMIN_LINK=true` to show a debug link to `/admin/jobs` on the public jobs page even when signed out.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
